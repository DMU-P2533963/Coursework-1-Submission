  <p>Sunny Suljic is an american actor and skater who was casted from a skate park by Jonah Hill for the movie Mid90's Sunny's performance in the movie makes it hard to believe he was only 11 at the time of recording.
    From the emotion packed drama to just pretending to skate bad, his performance lacks very little.<p> <!-- The <p> tag allows this element to be specifically styled in CSS using ".textbox1 p{}" -->

  <p>As an actor, the world knows Jonah Hill right along other brilliant names for his roles in Wolf Of Wall Street, 21 Jump Street and early on in Superbad. But when it comes to directing, it's a very different story.
    Mid90's was Jonah Hills directorial debut and it did not dissapoint. The attention to detail in the movie is frightening from the fashion sense, to the music to even how trash looks on the street.
