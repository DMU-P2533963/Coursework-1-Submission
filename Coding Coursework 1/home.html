<p>Mid90s is a 2018 American coming-of-age comedy-drama film written and directed by Jonah Hill, it takes a group of skaters in Los Angeles and puts them through the trails of life skating in the 90's.
It demonstrates the key aspect to adulthood at a young age brilliantly and pays homage to the 90's skate scene perfectly.</p>
